            <div class="scenario">
                <h3>The Scenario</h3>
                <p><strong>TechNow Solutions</strong> is a small IT company with 35 employees located in a two-story office building. On Monday morning at 10:30 AM, a significant safety incident occurred that affected multiple employees.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background Information</h3>
            <p>TechNow Solutions has recently moved to a new office space. The company has a health and safety coordinator, Maria, who was hired three months ago. The office layout is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Reception, conference rooms, kitchen area</li>
                <li><strong>First Floor:</strong> Open office space, server room, IT support area</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency exits:</strong> Main entrance and a side fire exit (occasionally blocked by storage boxes)</li>
                <li><strong>Fire extinguishers:</strong> Located near the kitchen and server room only</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Incident</h3>
            <p>On Monday morning, an electrical fire started in the server room on the first floor. Here's what happened:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Employee James, working nearby, noticed smoke and immediately alerted his colleagues.</li>
                <li>The fire alarm was activated, but several employees were confused about evacuation procedures.</li>
                <li>One employee, Sarah, attempted to use the fire extinguisher but had never been trained on its proper use.</li>
                <li>The side emergency exit was blocked by storage boxes, forcing people to use only the main entrance.</li>
                <li>An elderly employee, Robert, had difficulty evacuating due to mobility issues and received assistance from a colleague.</li>
                <li>The fire brigade arrived 8 minutes after the 911 call and quickly extinguished the fire.</li>
                <li>Two employees suffered minor smoke inhalation, but no serious injuries occurred.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>
            <p>After the incident, an investigation was conducted. Maria realized that several health and safety measures were not properly implemented despite being company policy.</p>
